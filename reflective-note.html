      <h2>My Thoughts</h2>
      <p>
        Designing this lesson on supply chain management using AI integration allowed me to blend conventional concepts with emerging technologies. The structure provided by the lesson plan ensured clarity, while the use of podcasts and visual aids improved student engagement.
      </p>
      <p>
        Incorporating quizzes and exit tickets helped assess student learning outcomes effectively. I observed that students were more curious about AI applications in everyday operations, which led to deeper discussions and exploratory learning.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall, this toolkit empowers both teaching and self-paced learning. I plan to refine the flashcard and image sections to be more interactive in future sessions.
